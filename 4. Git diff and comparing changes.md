Use git diff to compare changes between
- commits
- branches
- files
- working directory and more

git diff
- by default, it shows difference between changes in our working directory that are not staged for the next commit
- compares staging area and working directory
- the files should be added to the staging area at least once in order for this command to work, otherwise it will ignore the file (eg: if you create a new file but haven't added it, git diff wont show the difference that the file is in working directory but not in staging area) -- however, git diff head will show the changes in this case.
git diff HEAD
- lists all changes in our working directory since our last commit
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
- both are same (aliases)
- shows the difference between staging area and last commit
Diffing specific files
- we can pass file names as arguments to any of these diff commands and it shows only changes in those files
git diff branch-1 branch-2
- shows the difference between two branches
git diff commit-hash1 commit-hast2
- shows the difference between two commits

For stashing, checkout [[5. Stashing]]
