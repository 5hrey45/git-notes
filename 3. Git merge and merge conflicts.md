For git branching and switching branches, checkout [[2. Git Branching and switching branches]]

To merge, two steps
1. switch to the branch you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch)
2. use git merge command to merge changes from a specific branch to the current branch
example
- git switch master
- git merge bugfix
if the receiving branch does not have any new commits when the branch was created, it will be a fast forward merge
if new work and commits were present, we will get a merge commit and potentially a merge conflict.

the default merge process should open editor and ask for merge commit message (but sometimes not so the default message will be there)
use the below to add custom merge commit message.

git merge branch-name -m "merge commit message"

if we have merge conflicts and we resolved it, we need to commit the changes.
