Previous [[6. Undoing changes and time travelling]]

git clone url
- clones the repo to local machine
- make sure you are not in a repo before cloning

Remotes
- think of it as a destination url

git remote
git remove -v
- displays remotes (-v for verbose)

Adding new remotes

git remote add name url
- eg: git remote add origin https://github/exampleurl

git remote rename old-name new-name
- git remote rename origin myrepo

git remote remove name
- git remote remove origin

Pushing

git push remote branch
- eg: git push origin master
- pushes the changes from master (local) to master (github)

git push remote local-branch:remote-branch
- pushes the changes from local-branch to remote-branch
- the local-branch and remote-branch can be same or different
- if the remote-branch does not exist, it will create and then push

git push -u origin branch
- -u set's the upstream for the local-branch
- if we once use:
	- git push -u origin dogs
- by default the local-branch dogs will push to remote-branch dogs (upstream) when we use
	- git push
	- dogs -> dogs (pushes to dogs)
- so we can simple use git push, it will push the local-branch to it's upstream which was previously specified by -u flag
- we can also set a different upstream for dogs:
	- git push -u origin dogs:cats
- so next time we use:
	- git push
	- dogs -> cats (pushes to cats)
