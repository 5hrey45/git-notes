git branch -r
- shows the branch reference of the remote repo
- ie., shows origin/master which points to the last commit of the remote branch when the last time we visited the repo

Suppose we cloned a repo with 2 branches, main and movies, but in local machine, we only see main when we do git branch
- but if we do git branch -r, we also see origin/movies

Now to create a local-branch movies and connect it to origin movies, we can simply use
- git switch movies 
- (even if the movies branch does not exist in local-machine, it will create and connect it to remote-branch of the same name)
- OR, we can also use
- git checkout --track origin/movies
- This also gives the same result as git switch movies

git fetch remote
- Fetches changes from remote-repo and bring it to the local-repo
- does not bring changes to working directory (git pull does that)
- fetches changes from all the branches
- eg: git fetch origin
- if remote is not specified, defaults to origin
- suppose new branch was created in remote-repo, the local-repo does not know about this, but after git fetch it will be updated

git fetch remote branch
- git fetch origin movies
- will fetch the changes from movies branch in origin remote

git pull remote branch
- it will fetch the data from the remote-repo and updates our working directory
- think of it as git fetch + git merge
- like git merge, it matters where we run this command from
- whatever branch we run it from is where the changes will be merged into
- eg: git pull origin master
	- fetches the latest changes from origin master and merges those changes into our current branch
- **not recommended if we have uncommitted changes**

git pull
- remote defaults into origin
- branch defaults into whatever the tracking connection configured for the current branch
