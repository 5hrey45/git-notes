git checkout commit-hash
- goes to that commit, so we can view that commit (and history will be upto that commit)
- head detached, usually head points to a branch reference and branch ref points to tip of the commit
- flow goes like this
- head -> master -> latest commit (say commit #6)
- when head is detached, flow will be like this
- head -> commit #3
- master -> latest commit (commit #6)
- here, we used git checkout and gave commit hast of 3rd commit, hence head is detached from master branch ref and is pointing to 3rd commit
- to reattach head to master or on the branch ref
- use either git switch master or git checkout master

To create a new branch based upon an earlier commit:
- first checkout to that specific commit
- then create a new branch

git checkout head~1
- refers to the commit before head (parent)
git checkout head~2
- refers to 2 commits before head (grandparent)
git checkout head~n
- refers to n commits before head

git switch -
git checkout -
- switches to the branch which we were in last time

git checkout head file1 file2 ...
git checkout -- file1 file2 ...
- discards uncommitted changes
- removes/restores contents of the given file by taking changes from last commit (head)
git checkout head~n file1
- restores the file contents how it was in n commits before head

git restore file1
- does the same as
	- git checkout head file1
git restore --source head~n file1
- does the same as
	- git checkout head~n file1

git restore --staged file1
- unstages file1 from staging area

git reset commit-hash
- removes all the commits **after** the specified commit-hash
- undo's commits **until** the specified commit
- but the changes/contents in file are not changed
- i.e., files are not modified to reflect the latest commit (commit-hash specified in git reset)
- to change files to reflect that commit hash use:
	1. git restore file1
		- this works since the head is pointing to latest commit (which is the commit hash in git reset command)
	2. OR use git reset --hard commit-hash
- we don't lose the changes in the working directory
- only the commits are deleted
- this is useful to delete some commits on one branch, the working directory is not changed, then branch off and then commit the changes in the working directory in the new branch

git reset --hard commit-hash
- removes both commits and changes in files

git revert commit-hash
- it also undo's changes **including the specified commit-hash**
- but does not remove commits specified after the commit-hash
- creates a new commit which contains the reverted changes

flow b/w git reset and git revert
1 commit -> 2 commit -> 3 commit -> 4 commit
1              ->   12          -> 123          -> 1234

git reset 2 commit
1 commit -> 2 commit
1              -> 12

git revert 3 commit
1 commit -> 2 commit -> 3 commit -> 4 commit -> 3 reverted
1              ->  12             ->  123          -> 1234        -> 12

Use git reset if the commits you need to undo are local to your machine and no other collaborators have it.
If they have those commits and you delete using git reset, it leads to problems. In such cases, use git revert.
