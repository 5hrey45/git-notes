For git basics, check out [[1. Git Basics - adding, committing and logs]]

we start out of default branch master

git branch 
- lists all the branches in the repo
- look out for * which indicates the current branch (the branch we are currently in)
git branch -v
- same as above, but lists out branches with more details
- I think -v flag is for verbose
git branch branch-name
- it creates a new branch **based upon the current head**
- but does not switch to that branch
git switch branch-name
- switches to the branch specified
git switch -c branch-name
- creates the branch then switches to that branch
git checkout branch-name
- switches to the branch specified
git checkout -b branch-name
- creates the branch then switches to that branch

You cannot switch branches with unstaged changes (with tracking files)
So you either need to commit, then switch or stash your changes then switch branch.
Unstaged changes but not tracked files comes to whatever branch you switch to.
But once you add that file for tracking and commit, it will be deleted from the branch which does not track it (the branch it came from or if you committed on the branch it originated from, then it will be deleted from the branch it came to)

git branch -d branch-name
- deletes the specified branch
- we should not be inside that branch, otherwise it cannot delete the branch that's checked out
- **the branch must be fully merged in it's upstream branch in order for it to be deleted**
git branch -D branch-name
- shortcut for --delete --force
- deletes the branch irrespective of it's merge status
git branch -m new-branch-name
- renames the branch that we are currently in.
- we need to be inside the branch to rename it.
