For diffing, checkout [[4. Git diff and comparing changes]]

when you do some work on one branch and then try to switch to other branch without committing changes, one of the two things happens:
1. Changes come to destination branch if no conflict occurs(but once you go back and commit, it will disappear from destination branch)
2. If potential conflict, git won't let us switch branches
	in this case, we need to either
	1. commit our changes
	2. stash them

git stash
git stash save
- both are same
- stashes (saves) the uncommitted changes
- reverts the changes in working directory

git stash pop
- remove the most recently stashed changes in the stash and reapply in working directory
- stash taken in LIFO order

git stash apply
- applies whatever is stashed away, without removing it from the stash
- useful when we want to apply stashed changes to multiple branches

git stash list
- shows all stashes
- output will be like
	- stash@{0}
	- stash@{1}
	- stash@{2}

git stash apply stash@{2}
- this applies stash@{2} stashed changes to current working directory

git stash drop stash@{2}
- deletes the referenced stash (in this case, stash@{2})

git stash clear
- deletes/clears out all the stashes
